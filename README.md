# ECCS1621-MP2
## Description: 
This program is met to emulate the product "LED Word Clock - Displays Time as Text - Powered by AC Adapter (12" x 12")", which provides a display clock that is a series of words that spell out "It is half ten quarter twenty five minutes to past two three one four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve o'clock". This seemingly random string of words will light up, using LEDs that are accurate to the current time. for example, if it is 6:45, the LEDs will light up the phrase "It is quarter to seven O'clock".
